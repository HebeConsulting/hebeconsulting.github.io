You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

![Kuuuzuuu](/assets/kuzu.jpg){:.img-fluid}

![Trompa](/assets/elefante.png){:.mx-auto .d-block .col-10 .col-md-10 }

<figure class="video_container">

</figure>

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight r %}
  library(dplyr)
  library(readxl)

  data = read_excel("input.xlsx", sheet="index")
  filtered = data %>% select(1:5)
{% endhighlight %}
